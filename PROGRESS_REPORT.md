### Step 1: Complete Phase 2 (Cloning & Branching) - Priority: High
   - **Why?** This builds Git/GitHub skills and gets everyone contributing.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Remind team members (Faraz) to follow the quick start in TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md.
     2. Have them clone the repo, create their branches (e.g., `feature-faraz`), add a sample file (like a personal note in their .md file), commit, push, and create PRs.
     3. Review and merge their PRs on GitHub (use "Squash and merge" as recommended).
     4. Update README.md status to mark Phase 2 complete.
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 days. Follow up if they delay.

### Step 2: Oversee Phase 3 (Project Development) - Priority: High
   - **Why?** This simulates feature development; even though the site is built, have members "contribute" by modifying sections or adding content.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Assign tasks as per TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md (Ali: Hero/Dashboard, Muneeb: Skills, Faraz: Projects).
     2. Have members work on their branches: Edit TeamPortfolio/index.html or CSS/JS files to add/improve their sections (e.g., Faraz updates project cards).
     3. They commit, push, and submit PRs.
     4. Review PRs, provide feedback, and merge.
     5. Update PROJECT_REPORT.md with individual contributions and screenshots.
   - **Timeline**: 3-5 days. If the site is already perfect, have them make small enhancements (e.g., add accessibility or new projects).

### Step 3: Facilitate Phase 4 (Conflict Resolution) - Priority: Medium
   - **Why?** Teaches handling real-world issues; required for marks.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Instruct one member to edit a shared file (e.g., both modify the same section in index.html) to create a conflict.
     2. Have them push changes, then resolve the conflict using CONTRIBUTING.md steps.
     3. Document the process in CONTRIBUTING.md or a new section.
     4. Update README.md status.
   - **Timeline**: 1 day.

### Step 4: Handle Phase 5 (Documentation & Testing) - Priority: Medium
   - **Why?** Finalizes the project and proves functionality.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. ✅ Fill PROJECT_REPORT.md: Add abstract, objectives, features, screenshots (take from the live site), testing notes, and individual contributions.
     2. Test the site locally (open index.html in browser, check responsiveness, forms, links).
     3. Update README.md with final status.
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days.
   - **Status**: ✅ Complete - PROJECT_REPORT.md fully documented

### Step 5: Prepare Phase 6 (Presentation & Submission) - Priority: Low (Do Last)
   - **Why?** Showcases the work to the class.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Create presentation slides (PowerPoint/Google Slides) covering: Project overview, team roles, Git workflow demo, challenges, and lessons learned.
     2. Share the GitHub repo link.
     3. Practice presenting (5-10 minutes).
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 days before deadline.

## Tips for Success
- **Communication**: Use GitHub Issues or a group chat to coordinate. Set weekly check-ins.
- **Tools**: Ensure team uses GitHub Desktop or VS Code for ease.
- **Backup**: If members struggle, guide them via screen share.
- **Mark Optimization**: Focus on collaboration (15 marks) and documentation (15 marks) to maximize score.
- **If Stuck**: Contact your instructor for clarification on phases.
