# Project Progress Report - IT Project Management Team Portfolio

## Team Lead Assessment
**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Team Lead:** Muhammad Ali Sheikh (70151489)  
**Status:** Phase 2 In Progress  

## Current Progress Summary
- **Phase 1 (Setup & Planning)**: ✅ **Fully Complete** - Repository created, team defined, README, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, and basic structure in place.
- **Phase 2 (Cloning & Branching)**: ⏳ **Partially Started** - Guidelines are documented, but team members haven't completed the cloning/branching process yet (no merged branches visible in the repo).
- **Phase 3 (Project Development)**: ⏳ **Partially Complete** - The portfolio website (TeamPortfolio/index.html) is fully built with all sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Team, Contact), but team members haven't contributed via branches yet. Feature assignments are defined, but individual contributions need to be integrated.
- **Phase 4 (Collaboration & Conflict Resolution)**: ⏹️ **Not Started** - No merge conflicts simulated or documented.
- **Phase 5 (Documentation & Testing)**: ⏹️ **Not Started** - PROJECT_REPORT.md is a template; needs filling with details, screenshots, and testing.
- **Phase 6 (Presentation & Submission)**: ⏹️ **Not Started** - No presentation slides or final repo link prepared.

**Overall**: About 30-40% complete. The foundation is solid, but the collaborative phases (team contributions, conflicts, docs) are pending. The website itself is functional, but phases require team member involvement to meet the learning objectives.

## Remaining Work Overview
- **Key Gaps**: Team members (Muneeb and Faraz) need to actively participate in branching, committing, and PRs. The site is built, but phases require simulating real team work (even if the final product is ready).
- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 weeks if team works consistently (2-3 hours per member per phase).
- **Risks**: If team members don't contribute, you'll lose marks in collaboration and individual contribution categories (total 30 marks).

## Easy Steps for What You Need to Do Now (As Team Lead)
Follow these sequential steps to guide your team through the remaining phases. Start with Phase 2 immediately.

### Step 1: Complete Phase 2 (Cloning & Branching) - Priority: High
   - **Why?** This builds Git/GitHub skills and gets everyone contributing.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Remind team members (Muneeb and Faraz) to follow the quick start in TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md.
     2. Have them clone the repo, create their branches (e.g., `feature-muneeb`, `feature-faraz`), add a sample file (like a personal note in their .md file), commit, push, and create PRs.
     3. Review and merge their PRs on GitHub (use "Squash and merge" as recommended).
     4. Update README.md status to mark Phase 2 complete.
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 days. Follow up if they delay.

### Step 2: Oversee Phase 3 (Project Development) - Priority: High
   - **Why?** This simulates feature development; even though the site is built, have members "contribute" by modifying sections or adding content.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Assign tasks as per TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md (Ali: Hero/Dashboard, Muneeb: Skills, Faraz: Projects).
     2. Have members work on their branches: Edit TeamPortfolio/index.html or CSS/JS files to add/improve their sections (e.g., Muneeb adds animated skill bars, Faraz updates project cards).
     3. They commit, push, and submit PRs.
     4. Review PRs, provide feedback, and merge.
     5. Update PROJECT_REPORT.md with individual contributions and screenshots.
   - **Timeline**: 3-5 days. If the site is already perfect, have them make small enhancements (e.g., add accessibility or new projects).

### Step 3: Facilitate Phase 4 (Conflict Resolution) - Priority: Medium
   - **Why?** Teaches handling real-world issues; required for marks.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Instruct one member to edit a shared file (e.g., both modify the same section in index.html) to create a conflict.
     2. Have them push changes, then resolve the conflict using CONTRIBUTING.md steps.
     3. Document the process in CONTRIBUTING.md or a new section.
     4. Update README.md status.
   - **Timeline**: 1 day.

### Step 4: Handle Phase 5 (Documentation & Testing) - Priority: Medium
   - **Why?** Finalizes the project and proves functionality.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Fill PROJECT_REPORT.md: Add abstract, objectives, features, screenshots (take from the live site), testing notes, and individual contributions.
     2. Test the site locally (open index.html in browser, check responsiveness, forms, links).
     3. Update README.md with final status.
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days.

### Step 5: Prepare Phase 6 (Presentation & Submission) - Priority: Low (Do Last)
   - **Why?** Showcases the work to the class.
   - **Your Actions**:
     1. Create presentation slides (PowerPoint/Google Slides) covering: Project overview, team roles, Git workflow demo, challenges, and lessons learned.
     2. Share the GitHub repo link.
     3. Practice presenting (5-10 minutes).
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 days before deadline.

## Tips for Success
- **Communication**: Use GitHub Issues or a group chat to coordinate. Set weekly check-ins.
- **Tools**: Ensure team uses GitHub Desktop or VS Code for ease.
- **Backup**: If members struggle, guide them via screen share.
- **Mark Optimization**: Focus on collaboration (15 marks) and documentation (15 marks) to maximize score.
- **If Stuck**: Contact your instructor for clarification on phases.
